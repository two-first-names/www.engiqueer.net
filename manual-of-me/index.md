I've been talking about putting together a proper Manual of Me for so long now, so here it is. ðŸ’œ This largely applies to those who work directly with me, but hopefully it's useful to those I interact with elsewhere.

So to begin with, the basics. I'm Joe, I'm a Senior Site Reliability Engiqueer at the Government Digital Service in the UK. My pronouns are They/Them, I'm 28 (TODO: update this/work out a way to automate this before it becomes outdated) and I live with my Corgi/Poodle Peggy!

## Conditions I like to work in

## The times I like to work

## The best way to communicate with me

## The ways I like to receive feedback

## Things I need

## Things I struggle with

## Things I love

## Other things to know about me
